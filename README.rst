wvim2
=====

Web Vim powered by JavaScript.

Why I wrote this
----------------

I love vim, vim is the first editor I know that can be used without mouse.


One day in my university third grade, I said

"Don't know what to do, how about writing a vim?"

`Then I start to write one. <http://www.nba.nctu.edu.tw/~pi314/pi314/Working/wVim/wvim.html>`_

Those days, I happily wrote my vim with Notepad++.

But later I have a lot of homeworks, the project just stopped.

June 2013, I recalled this project,
but my coding style is so bad that I can't do more update on it.
So I decided to rebuild it.

July 2013, I starts to work on this project.
Because JavaScript has no "import" statements,
I prepare a little script to manage my JavaScript files.

wvim2 depends on my another project `KeyManager <https://github.com/pi314/KeyManager>`_.

I have Cygwin now, so I can write vim with vim. (happy

I developed this project in Google Chrome, not completely tested in other browsers yet.

I didn't use git to manage this project at start, so I do log my self, in the log.txt .
